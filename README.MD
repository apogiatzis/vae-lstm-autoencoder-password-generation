# LSTM Autoencoders for Generating Passwords

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/apogiatzis/vae-lstm-autoencoder-password-generation/blob/master/autoencoders.ipynb)

This repository contains the relevant code for the Part 2 of the post series named ["Demystifying Generative Models by Generating Passwords"](https://medium.com/@apogiatzis/demystifying-generative-models-by-generating-passwords-part-2-38ad3c325a46).

It contains code for training and testing a Standard and Variational LSTM Autoencoder for generating new passwords based on a training set of 1000 passwords. 

It is recommended that you read the relevant blog post provided above to fully understand the reasoning behind the code.

Any contributions are welcome!
